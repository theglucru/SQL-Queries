# SQL-Queries
SQL queries I had in Mode from a Coursera class

SELECT *
FROM dsv1069.users

SELECT email_address
FROM dsv1069.users
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL

SELECT *
FROM dsv1069.orders o JOIN dsv1069.users u
  ON o.user_id = u.id
  
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT event_id)
FROM dsv1069.events
WHERE event_name = 'view_item'
AND event_id IS NOT NULL

SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT item_id) AS item_count
  FROM dsv1069.orders
  
  SELECT users.id AS user_id, MIN(orders.paid_at) AS min_paid_at
FROM dsv1069.users
  LEFT JOIN dsv1069.orders
  ON users.id = orders.user_id
GROUP BY users.id

SELECT
  (CASE WHEN first_view is NULL then false
    ELSE true END) AS has_viewed_profile_page,
  COUNT(user_id) AS users
FROM 
  (SELECT
    users.id AS user_id,
    MIN(event_time) as first_view
  FROM
    dsv1069.users
  LEFT OUTER JOIN
    dsv1069.events
  ON 
    events.user_id = users.id
  AND 
    event_name = 'view_user_profile'
  GROUP BY 
    users.id
  ) first_profile_views
GROUP BY 
  (CASE WHEN first_view IS NULL THEN false
    ELSE true END)
